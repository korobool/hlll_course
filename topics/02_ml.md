# In-Depth Look at Machine Learning Paradigms

Machine Learning is a dynamic and expansive field, encompassing various paradigms each suited to different kinds of problems. Below, we delve deeper into Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning, offering insights into their methodologies, applications, and resources for advanced learning.

## Supervised Learning

In Supervised Learning, the algorithm learns on a labeled dataset, providing an answer key that the algorithm can use to evaluate its accuracy on training data.

### Key Concepts

- **Classification** involves predicting labels or categories (e.g., spam or not spam).
- **Regression** deals with predicting a continuous quantity (e.g., house prices).

### Important Algorithms

- Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks.

### Formula Example (Logistic Regression)

For binary classification:
$$ \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} $$
where $z = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$ and $\sigma(z)$ is the sigmoid function.

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised Learning involves learning patterns from untagged data. The system tries to learn without instruction, finding structure in the input data.

### Key Concepts

- **Clustering** is used to find groups of similar instances in the data.
- **Dimensionality Reduction** and **Feature Learning** help understand data by reducing its complexity.

### Important Algorithms

- K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Autoencoders.

### Formula Example (PCA)

Principal component for dimensionality reduction:
$$ PCA(X) = XW $$
where $X$ is the data matrix, and $W$ is the matrix of eigenvectors.

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning teaches the algorithm to act based on rewards received for actions taken, learning policies for achieving long-term goals.

### Key Concepts

- **Policy:** A strategy that the agent employs to determine the next action based on the current state.
- **Reward Signal:** Defines the goal in a reinforcement learning problem.
- **Value Function:** Tells us how good it is for an agent to be in a given state.

### Important Algorithms

- Q-Learning, Deep Q Network (DQN), Policy Gradients, and Actor-Critic methods.

### Formula Example (Q-Learning)

Update rule for Q-Learning:
$$ Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha [r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)] $$
